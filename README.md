Breakdown of work:

March 26th (Started Work on 1st Sprint (EDIT AND DELETE Functions))
Chris Poon:
I worked on the following tasks:
1. Edit a Reminder Implementation - Researched how to create the `update` method.
2. Edit a Reminder Implementation - Successfully completed the `edit` method by adding the 
``` searchResult.title = req.body.title;
    searchResult.description = req.body.description;
```
and adding an if statement for the "True/False Reminder Completed" Radio Button.
